#A program written by Weronika Wolska that generates a random number between 1 and 10 and asks the user to guess the number

import random
answer = random.randint(1,10)
chances = 3

while chances != 0:
    guess = int(input("Enter your guess: "))
    if guess is answer:
        print ("Congratulations! You guessed the number!")
        break
    else:
        chances = chances -1
        print ("Oops! You guessed incorrect. You have", chances, "chances left")

if chances is 0:
    print ("Sorry, you lost the game! The correct number was", answer)
